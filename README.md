## FAQ

| Question            | Answer                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How I do this?      | Just pull down and run index.html with live server.                                                                                                       |
| Why no server?      | Because it's due monday and ain't no body got time for that right now with midterms, covid and etc.                                                       |
| You want server.    | Yes, I do. I'll probably implement it later with MongoDB or Sequelize. (John will huant me if I don't learn Sequelize)                                    |
| Why pages recreate? | I want to get some commits in, and I notice all the points are weighed on HTML and CSS only... I don't know if I'll get much points if I just do backend. |
| You do logo!?       | Yes... give me time. Might just roll with a gamepad for now, but it'll get done.                                                                          |
| Why Name Change?    | C3PO started sounding lame, I chose Atomic because an Atom is indivisible, and I feel like thats what this company will stand for. Open for suggestions.  |
